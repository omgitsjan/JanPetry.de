          content: |
            I specialize in full-stack web development with Nuxt/Vue, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern cloud tooling. I build marketing sites, web apps, content platforms, and integrations.
        - label: "What is your process like?"
          content: |
            Typically: Discovery → Scope → Design/Architecture → Implementation → QA → Launch → Iterate. I work in short, transparent cycles with regular check-ins and demos.
        - label: "Which programming languages and tools do you use?"
          content: |
            Daily stack: TypeScript, Vue/Nuxt, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and cloud providers (Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io). I choose tools based on goals and constraints.
        - label: "Do you collaborate with agencies or partners?"
